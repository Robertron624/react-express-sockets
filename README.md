# react-express-sockets

This is a simple chat app to getting starting with my web-sockets learning, The frontend is made with react and tailwindcss, 
the backend is made with express.js.

To start the app just run `npm run dev` command inside the root folder to start the server, then enter the "client" folder and in the terminal
run `npm run start` command to start the frontend server, by default, the server is using the 4000 port and the frontend server is using 3000.
